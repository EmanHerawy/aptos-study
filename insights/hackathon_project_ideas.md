# Hackathon Project Ideas Leveraging Aptos Capabilities

This document provides structured project ideas for hackathon participants, organized by theme and highlighting Aptos's unique technical capabilities.

## DeFi & Payments Innovation

### 1. Gas-Free DeFi Platform
**Leverages: Sponsored Transactions**
- **Concept**: Create a DeFi protocol where new users can interact without holding APT tokens
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Backend service acts as fee payer for qualified transactions
  - Transaction validation to only sponsor specific function calls
  - Usage limits per user/session for sustainability
  - Small protocol fees once users are established to recover costs
- **Why On Aptos**: Leverages native sponsored transactions to create a smoother onboarding experience that's difficult to achieve on other chains

### 2. Multi-Party Treasury Management
**Leverages: Protocol-Level Multisig**
- **Concept**: Build a treasury management system for DAOs or organizations
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use native K-of-N signature scheme without additional smart contracts
  - Tiered access controls (e.g., 2/3 for small transactions, 3/5 for large ones)
  - Time-locked proposals with multisig execution
  - Efficient gas usage compared to contract-based multisig solutions
- **Why On Aptos**: Protocol-level multisig provides significant gas savings and improved security

### 3. Oracle-Powered Financial Products
**Leverages: Pyth Network Integration**
- **Concept**: Create financial products that react to real-world data
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Integration with Pyth price feeds for major assets
  - Dynamic interest rates based on market conditions
  - Automated portfolio rebalancing triggered by price thresholds
  - Use code patterns from Eman's oracle integration notes
- **Why On Aptos**: Efficient oracle integration with established Pyth Network

### 4. Cross-Chain Liquidity Protocol
**Leverages: Derivable Account Abstraction (DAA)**
- **Concept**: Build a finance platform accessible via identities from multiple chains
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use DAA to deterministically derive Aptos addresses from other chain credentials
  - No setup transaction required for users coming from other chains
  - Create consistent user experience across blockchain ecosystems
  - Bridge assets from multiple chains with a unified identity
- **Why On Aptos**: DAA enables seamless multi-chain identity without explicit on-chain registration

## Social, Gaming & NFTs

### 1. Provably Fair Game Platform
**Leverages: Native Randomness API**
- **Concept**: Create games with verifiable randomness that can't be manipulated
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use `#[randomness]` attribute for game mechanics
  - Implement card games, dice games, or random loot drops
  - Demonstrate protection against "test-and-abort" attacks
  - Design favorable outcomes to use more gas than unfavorable ones (security best practice)
- **Why On Aptos**: Native randomness API provides security guarantees that would require complex oracles on other platforms

### 2. Seamless Social Gaming Experience
**Leverages: Account Abstraction + Sponsored Transactions**
- **Concept**: Gaming platform with frictionless onboarding via social logins
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Social login through account abstraction
  - Sponsor initial transactions for new players
  - Assets remain fully owned by users despite easy authentication
  - Implement progressive security as user accounts gain value
- **Why On Aptos**: Combined account abstraction and sponsored transactions create a Web2-like experience with Web3 ownership

### 3. Resource-Based Dynamic NFTs
**Leverages: Move's Resource Model**
- **Concept**: Create NFTs with composable traits that evolve based on on-chain actions
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use Move's resource system for NFT attributes
  - Enforce type safety for all NFT operations
  - Store NFT data directly in account resources
  - Create clear composability between different NFT attributes
- **Why On Aptos**: Resource model enables safer, more efficient NFT implementation than traditional ERC standards

### 4. Decentralized Social Platform with Account-Based Profiles
**Leverages: Account-Centric Storage**
- **Concept**: Create a social network where users own their data as resources
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Store user profiles as resources in their own accounts
  - Use resource abilities to control data sharing permissions
  - Implement follow/friend relationships as cross-account references
  - Content ownership verification through resource trails
- **Why On Aptos**: Account-centric model provides natural alignment with social data ownership principles

## AI & New Frontiers

### 1. AI Task Allocation with Verifiable Randomness
**Leverages: Native Randomness API**
- **Concept**: Platform for distributing AI computational tasks fairly
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use randomness API to assign tasks without bias
  - Create verifiable proof of task completion
  - Implement random auditing of completed work
  - Fair reward distribution system
- **Why On Aptos**: Native randomness combined with efficient storage model creates a more secure and cost-effective platform

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Identity with Account Abstraction
**Leverages: Account Abstraction + Move Resources**
- **Concept**: Privacy-preserving identity system with selective disclosure
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Store encrypted credentials as typed resources
  - Use account abstraction for flexible verification methods
  - Implement selective disclosure of identity attributes
  - Create credential issuance and verification workflows
- **Why On Aptos**: Account abstraction enables complex authentication logic that would require extensive off-chain infrastructure elsewhere

### 3. Smart Wallet with Custom Spending Policies
**Leverages: Move Resource Model + Protocol-Level Multisig**
- **Concept**: Programmable wallet with customizable spending rules
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Define spending limits based on time, amount, or recipient
  - Implement automatic approval for trusted transactions
  - Create emergency recovery mechanisms
  - Use resource abilities to enforce policy constraints
- **Why On Aptos**: Resource model enables natural modeling of spending policies with strong safety guarantees

### 4. Cross-Chain Credential Verification
**Leverages: Derivable Account Abstraction**
- **Concept**: System for verifying credentials across multiple blockchains
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use DAA to map identities across chains
  - Create consistency checks for cross-chain reputation
  - Implement credential issuance and verification
  - Build a unified dashboard for managing cross-chain identity
- **Why On Aptos**: DAA provides superior cross-chain identity compared to traditional systems

## Implementation Guidelines

For each project idea, consider these implementation steps:

1. **Start with a prototype module structure**:
   ```move
   module my_address::my_project {
       use std::signer;
       use aptos_framework::account;
       use aptos_framework::event;
       
       // Resources
       struct ProjectState has key {
           // State fields
       }
       
       // Entry points
       public entry fun initialize(account: &signer) {
           // Setup logic
       }
       
       // Core functionality
       #[randomness] // If using randomness API
       public entry fun core_function(account: &signer) acquires ProjectState {
           // Implementation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Identify the unique Aptos features** your project will leverage and research their specific implementation requirements

3. **Design your resource model** carefully, considering what data needs to be stored and where

4. **Implement frontend** using the Aptos TypeScript SDK and appropriate wallet connectors

5. **Test thoroughly** using the Move test framework and on testnet before presenting
