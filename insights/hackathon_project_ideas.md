# Hackathon Project Ideas Leveraging Aptos Capabilities

This document provides structured project ideas for hackathon participants, organized by theme and highlighting Aptos's unique technical capabilities.

## DeFi & Payments Innovation

### 1. Gas-Free DeFi Platform
**Leverages: Sponsored Transactions**
- **Concept**: Create a DeFi protocol where new users can interact without holding APT tokens
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Backend service acts as fee payer for qualified transactions
  - Transaction validation to only sponsor specific function calls
  - Usage limits per user/session for sustainability
  - Small protocol fees once users are established to recover costs
- **Why On Aptos**: Leverages native sponsored transactions to create a smoother onboarding experience that's difficult to achieve on other chains

### 2. Multi-Party Treasury Management
**Leverages: Protocol-Level Multisig**
- **Concept**: Build a treasury management system for DAOs or organizations
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use native K-of-N signature scheme without additional smart contracts
  - Tiered access controls (e.g., 2/3 for small transactions, 3/5 for large ones)
  - Time-locked proposals with multisig execution
  - Efficient gas usage compared to contract-based multisig solutions
- **Why On Aptos**: Protocol-level multisig provides significant gas savings and improved security

### 3. Price-Feed Integrated Financial Products
**Leverages: Pyth Network Integration**
- **Concept**: Create financial products that react to real-world data
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Integration with Pyth Network for asset price feeds
  - Dynamic parameters based on market conditions
  - Automated portfolio rebalancing triggered by price thresholds
- **Implementation Note**: 
  While Oracle integration is common across blockchains (not unique to Aptos), the implementation differs:
  - Pyth on Aptos uses a single contract with price IDs rather than separate contracts per asset
  - Be aware of potential dependency conflicts as noted by Eman:
    > "I had problem when I was trying to integrate Pyth Oracle things because they are using specific commit and I was trying to get the latest Aptos framework and there's a conflict there."
  - Solution: Use the exact same Aptos Framework version that Pyth is using, or remove the framework dependency from your project

- **Example Integration**:
  ```move
  // Add to Move.toml
  [dependencies]
  Pyth = { git = "https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain.git", 
           subdir = "target_chains/aptos/contracts", 
           rev = "main" }
  
  [addresses]
  pyth = "0x7e783b349d3e89cf5931af376ebeadbfab855b3fa239b7ada8f5a92fbea6b387"
  wormhole = "0x5bc11445584a763c1fa7ed39081f1b920954da14e04b32440cba863d03e19625"
  
  // Usage in code
  module example::oracle_consumer {
      use pyth::pyth;
      use pyth::price::Price;
      use pyth::price_identifier;
      
      public fun get_eth_price(user: &signer, pyth_price_update: vector<vector<u8>>): Price {
          // Update price feeds
          let coins = coin::withdraw(user, pyth::get_update_fee(&pyth_price_update));
          pyth::update_price_feeds(pyth_price_update, coins);
          
          // Get price from feed
          let eth_price_id = price_identifier::from_byte_vec(x"ff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace");
          pyth::get_price(eth_price_id)
      }
  }
  ```

### 4. Cross-Chain Identity Finance
**Leverages: Derivable Account Abstraction (DAA)**
- **Concept**: Build a financial platform accessible via identities from multiple chains
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use DAA to deterministically derive Aptos addresses from other chain credentials
  - No setup transaction required - works instantly for users from other chains
  - Create consistent user experience across blockchain ecosystems
  - Implement cross-chain notifications and management tools
- **Why On Aptos**: DAA enables seamless multi-chain identity without explicit on-chain registration

## Social, Gaming & NFTs

### 1. Provably Fair Gaming Platform
**Leverages: Native Randomness API**
- **Concept**: Create games with verifiable randomness that can't be manipulated
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use `#[randomness]` attribute for game mechanics requiring fairness
  - Implement card games, dice games, or random loot drops
  - Demonstrate protection against "test-and-abort" attacks
  - Show how the randomness API is more secure than traditional methods
  - Example from Eman's notes showing randomness implementation:
    ```move
    #[randomness]
    entry fun decide_winner() {
      let winner_idx = aptos_framework::randomness::u64_range(0, n);
      // Use winner_idx
    }
    ```
- **Technical Note**:
  Be aware of the CLI ambiguity issue Eman encountered. When testing your randomness implementation, verify that your code actually compiled and is working correctly, as the CLI output `{ "Result": [] }` can be misleading.

### 2. Seamless Social Gaming Experience
**Leverages: Account Abstraction + Sponsored Transactions**
- **Concept**: Gaming platform with frictionless onboarding via social logins
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Enable social login through account abstraction
  - Sponsor initial transactions for new players
  - Assets remain fully owned by users despite easy authentication
  - Implement progressive security as user accounts gain value
- **Why On Aptos**: Combined account abstraction and sponsored transactions create a Web2-like experience with Web3 ownership

### 3. Resource-Based Dynamic NFTs
**Leverages: Move's Resource Model**
- **Concept**: Create NFTs with composable traits that evolve based on on-chain actions
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use Move's resource system for NFT attributes
  - Enforce type safety for all NFT operations
  - Store NFT data directly in account resources
  - Create clear composability between different NFT attributes
  - Draw from Eman's notes on Move storage for resource manipulation:
    ```move
    struct NFTTrait has key, store {
      level: u64,
      experience: u64
    }
    
    public fun level_up(addr: address) acquires NFTTrait {
      let trait = borrow_global_mut<NFTTrait>(addr);
      trait.level = trait.level + 1;
    }
    ```
- **Why On Aptos**: Resource model enables safer, more efficient NFT implementation than traditional ERC standards

### 4. Decentralized Social Platform with Account-Based Profiles
**Leverages: Account-Centric Storage + Resource Safety**
- **Concept**: Create a social network where users own their data as resources
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Store user profiles as resources in their own accounts
  - Use resource abilities to control data sharing permissions
  - Implement follow/friend relationships as cross-account references
  - Create content ownership verification through resource trails
- **Why On Aptos**: Account-centric model provides natural alignment with social data ownership principles

## AI & New Frontiers

### 1. AI Task Allocation with Verifiable Randomness
**Leverages: Native Randomness API**
- **Concept**: Platform for distributing AI computational tasks fairly
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use randomness API to assign tasks without bias
  - Create verifiable proof of task completion
  - Implement random auditing of completed work
  - Build a reward system with fair distribution
- **Why On Aptos**: Native randomness combined with efficient storage model creates a more secure and cost-effective platform

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Identity with Account Abstraction
**Leverages: Account Abstraction + Move Resources**
- **Concept**: Create a privacy-preserving identity system with selective disclosure
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Store encrypted credentials as typed resources
  - Use account abstraction for flexible verification methods
  - Implement selective disclosure of identity attributes
  - Create credential issuance and verification workflows
- **Why On Aptos**: Account abstraction enables complex authentication logic that would require extensive off-chain infrastructure elsewhere

### 3. Smart Wallet with Custom Spending Policies
**Leverages: Move Resource Model + Protocol-Level Multisig**
- **Concept**: Create a programmable wallet with customizable spending rules
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Define spending limits based on time, amount, or recipient
  - Implement automatic approval for trusted transactions
  - Create emergency override mechanisms
  - Use resource abilities to enforce policy constraints
  - Example based on Eman's notes on resource abilities:
    ```move
    struct SpendingPolicy has key {
      daily_limit: u64,
      trusted_addresses: vector<address>,
      // Other policy parameters
    }
    ```
- **Why On Aptos**: Resource model enables natural modeling of spending policies with strong safety guarantees

### 4. Cross-Chain Credential Verification
**Leverages: Derivable Account Abstraction**
- **Concept**: Build a system for verifying credentials across multiple blockchains
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use DAA to map identities across chains
  - Create consistency checks for cross-chain reputation
  - Implement credential issuance and verification
  - Build a unified dashboard for managing cross-chain identity
- **Why On Aptos**: DAA provides superior cross-chain identity compared to traditional systems

## Implementation Guidelines

For each project theme, I recommend providing participants with:

1. **Starter Templates** with basic implementations of the Aptos-specific features
   - Note: Based on Eman's feedback, ensure templates include all required files and structure
   - Quote from Eman: "The CLI template is horrible... it should be with at least the required files"

2. **Technical Documentation Links** pointing to the specific Aptos documentation:
   - Link to randomness API for gaming projects
   - Link to sponsored transaction implementation for gas-free experiences
   - Link to account abstraction documentation for identity projects

3. **Code Snippets** showing how to implement the key technical features:
   ```move
   // Example: Using protocol-level multisig
   public entry fun create_multisig(
     owners: vector<address>,
     threshold: u64
   ) {
     // Implementation details
   }
   ```

4. **Compilation Success Indicators**:
   - Help developers recognize when their code has actually compiled
   - Explain that `{ "Result": [] }` output can be ambiguous
   - Provide alternative verification methods

5. **Dependency Management Guidelines**:
   - Document known conflicts between packages (especially for Pyth Oracle integration)
   - Provide version combinations known to work together
   - Include examples of correct Move.toml configurations

These enhanced guidelines address the specific challenges Eman encountered during her learning process and will help hackathon participants avoid similar issues.
