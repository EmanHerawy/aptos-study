# Key Changes Based on Eman's Follow-up Feedback

Based on the second conversation with Eman and her additional notes, several important updates are needed to our insights. These changes focus particularly on CLI issues, development environment challenges, and clarifications about Aptos's unique features.

## 1. CLI and Development Environment Issues

### Critical CLI Improvements Needed
- **Ambiguous Compilation Results**: The output `BUILDING aptos_fighters { "Result": [] }` fails to clearly indicate success or failure
- **Misleading Test Output**: Tests can appear to pass even when syntax errors are present
- **Template System Limitations**: Current templates are minimal or empty, forcing developers to create boilerplate
- **Dependency Management Issues**: Conflicts between Pyth Oracle integration and Aptos Framework versions

### Direct Quote from Eman:
> "The CLI template is horrible... it should be with at least the required files"

### Implementation Priority:
Document these CLI challenges in our insights to help hackathon participants avoid common pitfalls. Add workarounds where possible.

## 2. Learning Process Insights

### Developer Learning Workflow
- Eman learns by migrating existing Solidity contracts to Move
- She first gains theoretical understanding, then implements
- When facing errors, she uses AI to help debug but verifies solutions

### Direct Quote from Eman:
> "I'm kind of person who love to understand the theory, the theoretical part. So whenever I'm stuck, I know exactly what I'm doing. I cannot like kind of having a black box."

### Implementation Priority:
Include this migration-based learning approach in our developer guidance, offering side-by-side examples.

## 3. Oracle Integration Clarification

### Oracle Implementation Specifics
- Clarify that Oracle integration itself isn't unique to Aptos, but the implementation differs
- Pyth Network on Aptos works differently than Chainlink on Ethereum:
  - Chainlink: Separate contract per asset pair
  - Pyth: Single address with price IDs

### Direct Quote from Eman:
> "I meant like this is kind of like any blockchain project would rely or use this kind of services so it's not making Aptos unique. It is like any hackathon project you will have this kind of integration."

### Implementation Priority:
Update our Oracle documentation to clarify the specific implementation details and differences.

## 4. Dependency Management Challenges

### Specific Technical Issues
- Conflicts between latest Aptos Framework and Pyth dependency versions
- Required using exact commit hash from Pyth project or removing framework import
- Spent significant time debugging dependency issues

### Direct Quote from Eman:
> "I had problem when I was trying to integrate Pyth Oracle things because they are using specific commit and I was trying to get the latest Aptos framework and there's a conflict there."

### Implementation Priority:
Add specific guidance on handling dependency conflicts, particularly for Pyth integration.

## 5. Clean Project Command Issues

### Developer Experience Problem
- Current `aptos move clean` command asks about deleting local package cache
- During hackathons, developers might miss this prompt and affect other projects
- Need separate command that only cleans project files without touching global cache

### Implementation Priority:
Document this behavior and provide clear guidance on safe project cleaning during hackathons.

## Files to Update

1. **interface_and_documentation_recommendations.md**: Add CLI-specific recommendations
2. **hackathon_project_ideas.md**: Clarify Oracle implementation specifics
3. **developer_migration_guide.md**: Enhance with migration-based learning approach
4. **aligned_hackathon_themes.md**: Update Oracle implementation details
5. **aptos_unique_features.md**: Clarify what is and isn't unique about Aptos

These changes will ensure our insights accurately reflect the developer experience based on Eman's hands-on feedback.
